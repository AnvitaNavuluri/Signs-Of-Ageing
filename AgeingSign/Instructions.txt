## Ageing_Sign_Batch_11

The zip file contains the following:

The *AgeData* folder contains the dataset used while implementing the project.

The *Python File* folder contains the Python files AgeTrain.py and AgeTest.py along with age.json and ageweights.h5 files created after training the model.

The *Colab Notebook* folder contains the .ipynb file and a sample pdf representation of the execution of the code along with the h5 and json files.

Few sample images are also inserted, which were used to test the project.


***********************************************************
#Python File#

1. Unzip the folder on your PC. 

2. Install the following modules:cv2, tensorflow

3. Open the file AgeTest.py and change variable file_name with the path to the testing image.

4. Execute the code with the statement: python AgeTest.py



************************************************************
#Colab Notebook#


To work with the #Face_detection_collab# file in the #Colab notebook# folder, follow the below steps:
1. Upload the whole unzipped folder on your google drive.

2. Double-click on the Face_detection_collab.ipynb file to open it in Google Colab.

3. Run the code in each segment by pressing shift+enter or simply click on the 'play' button next to the code.

4. In the second segment of the notebook the code will ask permission to access your google drive to be able to import necessary files from the unzipped folder you just uploaded.

5. Once you run that code, Google Colab will provide you with a link to that drive's access key. Copy it and paste it in the form provided.

6. Run all the imported code segment to import all the necessary package.

7. You can run the code segment one by one from the start to train the model yourself or Just sroll down to the **Load from Saved Model** and load the json files and continue from there.

8. Make sure to change the path as specified.

9. Do run the **Grayscaling function** segment too.

10. Skip the webcam segment and Run the input image segment to get the output.

11. Most of the code segments will run using shift+enter, without changing any part of the code.

12. Run all the #run_this_without_fail commented segment

12. The places where you have to type in the path of the specific file will be paired with a Comment specifying that you need to enter the path in that place.
